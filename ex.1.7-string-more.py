From now on you’re going to break all the code you
write or a friend’s code. I won’t have a Break It section explicitly in every exercise, but I will do this in
almost every video. Your goal is to ﬁnd as many different ways to break your code until you get tired or
exhaust all possibilities. In some exercises I might point out a speciﬁc common way people break that
exercise’s code, but otherwise consider this a standing order to always break it.

Common Student Questions
Why are you using the variable named 'snow'? That’s actually not a variable: it is just a string with
the word snow in it. A variable wouldn’t have the single-quotes around it.
Is it normal to write an English comment for every line of code like you say to do in Study Drill 1? No,
you write comments only to explain difficult-to-understand code or why you did something.
Why is usually much more important, and then you try to write the code so that it explains how
something is being done on its own. However, sometimes you have to write such nasty code
to solve a problem that it does need a comment on every line. In this case it’s strictly for you
to practice translating code to English.
Can I use single-quotes or double-quotes to make a string or do they do different things? In Python
either way to make a string is acceptable, although typically you’ll use single-quotes for any
short strings like 'a' or 'snow'.
