########## Ý NGHĨA CỦA LIST TRONG LẬP TRÌNH ############################
"""
Bản chất của lập trình là bắt chước thực tế.
That is all a list does, and this should give you a way to ﬁgure out concepts in programming. Every
concept in programming usually has some relationship to the real world. At least, the useful ones do. If
you can ﬁgure out what the analog in the real world is, then you can use that to ﬁgure out what the data
structure should be able to do.

1. List là một  data structure rất phổ biến trong lập trình.
2. Data structure là một kiểu dữ liệu máy tính.
What’s a data structure? If you think about it, a data structure is just a formal way to structure (organize)
some data (facts). It really is that simple. Even though some data structures can get insanely complex,
all they are is just a way to store facts inside a program so you can access them in different ways. They
structure data.

3.lists are one of the most common data structures programmers use. A list is
an ordered list of things you want to store and access randomly or linearly by an index.

########################## When to Use Lists #####################################################
You use a list whenever you have something that matches the list data structure’s useful features:
1. If you need to maintain order. Remember, this is listed order, not sorted order. Lists do not sort
for you.
2. If you need to access the contents randomly by a number. Remember, this is using cardinal
numbers starting at 0.
3. If you need to go through the contents linearly (ﬁrst to last). Remember, that’s what for-loops
are for.
This is when you use a list.
